    <h1>The fundamental differences between web 1.0, web 2.0 and web 3.0</h1>
    <p>Web 3.0 will involve potentially more security encryption for users with more interoperability where applications can run on several devices instead of only phones. This means a increase in the internet of things. </p>
    <p>The main differences between web 2.0 and web 1.0 is that web2.0 incolves more usability and personalisation on web platforms where users can open an online account, make status updates and blogs. </p>
<p> web 3.0 will involve more artificial intelligence. The initial stage of web 1.0 was only a one way communication and the web page was static </p>

<h2>Differences between front end and back end development </h2>
<p>Front end development is coding that relates to how users interact with a browser and interface. The main components for front end development involve HTML, CSS and Javascript. Back end development is the server side of the website and is also responsible for storing and fetching data.
Backend handles information that is available on the server and can be written with Javascript and Python. Backend handles databases that store large amounts of data.</p>

<h3>What happens when you open the world wide web? </h3> 
<p>Computers around us are connected with servers. Communicating through the internet has allowed us to access emails, surfing the web and taking conference calls. The web has servers  and servers are computers connected to the internet designed to store information and share it. The website has to be located with a website address which is a domain name and the information stored on the websites is in different languages like HTML and Javascript. </p>
The browsers have an interface and act as translators from what is coded behind the scenes. To access the internet, we need an internet service provider, web host and a registrar to reserve our web address. The web has a pattern that allows the organisation of information through hyperlinks. The hyperlinks link websites to other websites. </p>
